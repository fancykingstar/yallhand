# The Basics

Slab is a place to share knowledge with your team. Our editor is flexible and great for documenting everything from technical docs, how-to guides, official company information and more.

# Editor with rich content

Slab&#39;s editor supports more than just text - use the &quot;+&quot; button on the left of a new line to insert images, videos, lists and code snippets. Or, highlight a section and select one of the formatting options.
